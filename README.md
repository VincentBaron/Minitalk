## Project overview

This project was a first introduction to signals handling. The aim of the project was to create 2 processes and have them communicate a message from Process 1 to Process 2.

## What I learned

1. How processes work (pids, etc.)
2. How signals work and are handled (signal(), kill()).
3. Bit shifting to deconstruct and reconstruct a string from one process to an other.
